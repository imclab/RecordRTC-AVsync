Modified version of the RecordRTC demo at
https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/RecordRTC

This demo records audio and video at the same time and tries to playback them in sync.

It's very hacky. Probably better to wait for MediaRecorder API (you can try that out in Firefox Nightlies.)
